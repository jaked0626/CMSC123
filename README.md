# CMSC123

Course work for CMSC 123: Computer Sciene with Applications III at the University of Chicago. 

From the syllabus: 

"This course is about Big Data: the challenges of working with it, and the solutions that have ben developed to successfully overcome them. Topics include:

Algorithms:
considerations and changes needed when moving from smaller data sets to large ones
analysis of computational time and memory requirements and how they scale with data size
methods and conceptual frameworks for dividing up the work of an algorithm into separate tasks that can be run in parallel on multiple computing resources
C: an expansion of your programming skills to include, in your repertoire, arguably the most-widely used language in the world, a lingua franca for computer scientists, a low-level language that offers higher performance than interpreted languages such as Python
Big Data and cloud computing environments and programming paradigms:
MapReduce
Hadoop
Multi-process and multi-threaded programming
Concurrency and synchronization primitives (mutexes, condition variables)
MPI
Spark"
